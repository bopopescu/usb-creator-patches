TODO for usb-creator-kde:
-------------------------------------
 * Find out why resume from cancel install hangs the creator
 * Implement icons in treeview similar to gtk frontend (warning, etc)
   - need gio and get_gnome_drive equivalent functions from commit 205

TODO for usb-creator-win:
-------------------------

 * Resolve possible redistribution issue with Python for Windows 2.6 mentioned
   by Agostino Russo.
 * Improve the icon.  Get the icon working in the title bar.
 * Include sources for all of the code we're distributing.

General TODO:
-------------

 * Mac OSX support.  It looks like it requires GPT and a blessed image.  GRUB 2
   does not support it as of this writing (2009-07-09), which will have to
   happen first.  We'll also likely move to GRUB 2 at that point, assuming
   Ubuntu does first.
 * QA and testing
   - Successful install does not unmount USB Stick
   - Format USB stick fails to re-detect the formatted stick (format does not make a valid FS)
   - Cannot eject CD-ROM (held by root)
 * Create a backend.base.install class, replace usb-creator/install.py with
   backend.BACKEND.install.
